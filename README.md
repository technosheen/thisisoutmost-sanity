## Getting Started

Directions are also found on the [docs](https://sanitypress.dev/docs).

### 1. New repo

Clone or fork the template from [the GitHub template](https://github.com/nuotsu/sanitypress).

### 2. Get a new Sanity project ID

From the [Sanity.io Manage](https://sanity.io/manage) dashboard, create a new project _from scratch (blank schema) with CLI_.

### 3. Update environment variables

```sh
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL = ... # https://sanitypress.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID = ... # abcdefgh
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET = ... # production
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_TOKEN = ... # "Viewer" token from https://sanity.io/manage
```

### 4. Populate the Studio with your content

Open your new Sanity Studio (`‚Äåhttps://localhost:3000/admin`) and publish the following documents:

1. a **Site** document with a `title` field.
2. a **Page** document with slug: `index` to use as the _Home_ page.

For websites with a blog, additionally publish the following documents:

1. a **Page** document with slug: `blog` to use as the _Blog listing_ page.
2. a **Page** document with slug: `blog/*` to use as the _Blog post_ template page.

Optionally, you can publish the following documents:

- a **Page** document with slug: `404` to use as the _Page not found_ page.

#### Import a demo dataset

You can run a CLI command to import demo content to get SanityPress up and running in seconds.

```sh
sanity dataset import sanity/demo.tar.gz
```

This will import a Site document and a Page document with slug: index, the minimum requirements for SanityPress to deploy successfully.

### 5. Set up deployments

Install either of the following plugins to add a widget to your Studio Dashboard:

- Vercel: [`sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-vercel`](https://www.sanity.io/plugins/vercel-dashboard-widget)
- Netlify: [`sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-netlify`](https://www.sanity.io/plugins/sanity-plugin-dashboard-widget-netlify)

### 6. Customize

Adjust frontend styles, edit/add Sanity schema and modules, and more.
